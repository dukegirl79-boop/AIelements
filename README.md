## Summary

ISRTS is an AI‑powered tool that automatically categorizes, prioritizes, and routes incoming IT service requests. Instead of relying on manual triage—which is slow, inconsistent, and resource‑intensive—the system uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret request descriptions and assign them to the correct support queue with an appropriate priority level.
